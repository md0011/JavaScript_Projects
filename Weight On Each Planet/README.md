## Weight On Each Planet

Understanding the effects of gravity on different planets can be a fascinating journey into the realm of astrophysics. In this project, we will delve into the world of planetary weights and build a simple web application to calculate an individualâ€™s weight on various planets. By the end of this project, you will have a functioning web page that takes an Earth-weight input and displays the equivalent weights on Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

## Things You Will Learn:

1. **JavaScript:** Working with objects, functions, and loops.

2. **HTML:** Creating a user-friendly form for input.

3. **CSS:** Styling the webpage for a visually appealing experience.

4. **Web Development:** Integrating JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build a cohesive project.
